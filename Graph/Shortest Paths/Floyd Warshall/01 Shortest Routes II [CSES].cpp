/*
There are n cities and m roads between them. Your task is to process q queries 
where you have to determine the length of the shortest route between two given cities.

Input:
The first input line has three integers n, m and q: the number of cities, roads, and queries.
Then, there are m lines describing the roads. 
Each line has three integers a, b and c: there is a road between cities a and b whose length is c. 
All roads are two-way roads.
Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. 
Each line has two integers a and b: determine the length of the shortest route between cities a and b.

Output:
Print the length of the shortest route for each query. If there is no route, print âˆ’1 instead.
