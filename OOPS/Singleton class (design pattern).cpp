/*
Singleton design pattern is a software design principle that is used to restrict the instantiation of a class to one object. 
This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. 
For example, if you are using a logger, that writes logs to a file, you can use a singleton class to create such a logger. 
You can create a singleton class using the following code âˆ’
*/


/*
Private Constructor allows us to create objects of that class only inside the class. 
So outside any class we cant create object of that class.
This type of constructor is used in Singleton class. 
In which the class variable is created only inside a class or inside a public member function of that class. 
So that if we want to access a member of a class using that public member function we can access it.
